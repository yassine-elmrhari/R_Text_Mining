# Text Mining of Data Analysis Courses


## Description
This project performs text mining on multiple Data Analysis course chapters using R. It extracts and processes text from PDF files, cleans and tokenizes the text, computes term frequencies, and visualizes key statistics.


## Project Contents
1. **Installing and loading required packages** - Installing and loading necessary R packages.
2. **Importing and reading PDFs** - Extracting text from course chapters.
3. **Text preprocessing** - Removing special characters, numbers, stopwords, and stemming words.
4. **Creating Term-Document Matrices** - Analyzing word frequencies.
5. **Data merging and summarization** - Compiling results into structured tables.
6. **Visualization** - Generating plots to analyze term frequencies.


## Requirements
- **R (version 4.x or later)** 
- **RStudio (optional, but recommended)**
- **pdftools**
- **tm**
- **SnowballC**
- **reshape2**
- **dplyr**


## Installation and Execution
